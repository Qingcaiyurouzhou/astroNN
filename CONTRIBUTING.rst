Pull Request
-------------

This is a general guideline to make pull request (PR).

#. Go to https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN, click the ``Fork`` button.
#. Download your own ``astroNN`` fork to your computer by ``$git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/astroNN``.
#. Create a new branch with a short simple name that represents the change you want to make.
#. Make commits locally in that new branch, and push to your own ``astroNN`` fork.

New Model Proposal guide
-----------------------------
astroNN acts as a platform to share astronomy-oriented neural networks, so you are welcome to do so.

To add new models:

* Import your model in ``astroNN\models\__init__.py`` and add the model class name to ``__all__``
* Add a documentation page for the new model and add link it appropriately in ``docs\source\index.rst``
* Add the new model to the tree diagram and API under appropriate class in ``docs\souce\neuralnets\basic_usage.rst``
* Add the new model to the release history in ``docs\source\history.rst``

If your new model is proposed along with a paper, add your model to the test suite in ``tests\test_paper_models.rst``
just to make sure your model works fine against future changes in astroNN.

Possible New Features and Improvement in the future
----------------------------------------------------

.. topic:: GPU/performance related issues

    * Data reduction pipeline on GPU?
    * Multiple GPU support!
    * Training on large dataset that cant fit into memory?

.. topic:: Neural Network related issues

    * Currently the Bayesian NN models only use Dropout VI, maybe introduce more methods especially from TF-Probability
    * Have some nice VAE or GAN thing, maybe on spectroscopic data first
