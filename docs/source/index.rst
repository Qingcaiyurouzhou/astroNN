Welcome to astroNN's documentation!
======================================

astroNN is a python package to do various kinds of neural networks with targeted application in astronomy by using Keras API
as model and training prototyping, but at the same time take advantage of Tensorflow's flexibility.

For non-astronomy applications, astroNN contains custom loss functions and layers which are compatible with Tensorflow. The custom loss functions mostly designed to deal with incomplete labels.
astroNN contains demo for implementing Bayesian Neural Net with Dropout Variational Inference in which you can get
reasonable uncertainty estimation and other neural nets.

For astronomy applications, astroNN contains some tools to deal with APOGEE, Gaia and LAMOST data. astroNN is mainly designed
to apply neural nets on APOGEE spectra analysis and predicting luminosity from spectra using data from Gaia
parallax with reasonable uncertainty from Bayesian Neural Net. Generally, astroNN can handle 2D and 2D colored images too.
Currently astroNN is a python package being developed by the main author to facilitate his research
project on deep learning application in stellar and galactic astronomy using SDSS APOGEE, Gaia and LAMOST data.

For learning purpose, astroNN includes a deep learning toy dataset for astronomer - :doc:`/galaxy10`.

Getting Started
---------------
astroNN is developed on GitHub. You can download astroNN from its Github_.

But the easiest way to install is via ``pip``: astroNN on `Python PyPI`_

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install astroNN

.. _Python PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/astroNN/

For the latest version, you can clone the latest commit of astroNN from github

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN

and run the following command to install after you open a command line window in the package folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py install
